# Welcome to Team Mu's rendition of the Houston Street Subs Point of Sale System.

Through this project we hope to create a more accessible and usable Point of Sale System for resturaunts arounf campus. We specifically chose Houston Street Subs to show off the fantastic functionality of the application for this specific project.

We focused on making the UI readable and functional for those that are less than tech saavy, hard of vision, possessing tremors, or all of the above!

We believe that a resturaunt ordering system should be as accessible as possible so that all of our patron's needs are met and they are able to enjoy a pleasureable resturaunt experience despite their disabilities.

Over the course of the project our team utilized the experimental NextJS v13 in conjunction with Prisma for Postgres and Tailwind CSS to create a self contained, responsive, and extremely quick application. Through this we learned an extreme amount about the inner workings of web apps and the NextJS framework. We had to do a lot of trial and error and exploratory research when using this experiemntal version of NextJS, but that added to the depth that this project brought to our Software Engineering repitoire. 

## Thanks and Gig 'Em!
